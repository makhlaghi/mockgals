MockGals
=========

Make mock astronomical profiles (galaxy, star, ...) in a FITS file.
This README is just a short summary, please see the full documentation
on the page below for the full documentation:

Description:
------------

MockGals is a tool to make a pre-defined or random set of mock
galaxies in a simple `C` array or a FITS image.  The unique aspect of
MockGals is the three levels of accuracy used to approximate the
pixel value in the center of a profile: average of 10^4 random points,
integration and finally value from the profile center.

All extended profiles will be built with the first method for the
centeral pixel, as the difference between each method becomes smaller
than a tolerance level, the less accurate but faster method will be
used. It will also convolve the image of the raw profiles and add
noise to it. The parameters for the image PSF can also be provided.
The noise for every pixel is a random value taken from a Gaussian
distribution with sigma=sqrt(sky+pixel value) and mean=sky+pixel
value.


Prerequisits:
------------
MockGals requires several packages to be installed on your
machine, installing them is easy and straightforward. 

- [GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
  For integration and random number generation.
- [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/) 3. For convolution, configure with
  `--enable-float` flag.
- [cfitsio](http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html)
  For reading and writing FITS files.
- [ds9](http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html)
  To view the resulting Multiextension FITS files.

Installing and running:
------------

To install MockGals, after downloading or cloning it, all you have to
do is to run the standard configuring, compiling and installing
commands that are common to all GNU applications. In the downloaded
directory (`$` as user and `#` as root):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    # make install

See `./INSTALL` for a standard review of the GNU build and install
methods.

MockGals uses the standard GNU/Linux commandline options for
configuration, run `mockgals --help` for a complete list of options
and a short explanation.




Future updates:
------------

The list below is the list of things I can think of now that can make
MockGals a much more workable tool. I plan to work on these in the
future, when ever I get time. If you are interested in coding and would
want to help in adding these functionalities to it, it would be great,
please contact me and we can put them into action.

My final aim is to be able to completely simulate an observation night
at any telescope and make artifitial data so that we can test our
observational methods with it.

1. Add more functionality:
   - Positioning of stars.
   - 2D fits to galaxy light profiles.
   - Make 3D objects projected on a 2D surface.
   - Add a library of real objects from HST images to use.
   - Include instrumental defects: distortions, 
     various noise properties and varing sky among many.
   - Read positional paramters of each mock object in RA 
     and Dec. The user has to define the image center in RA 
     and Dec also and size in angular scales. With this 
     option physical criteria like extinction laws can also 
     come into play making it more realistic.
2. Work on a better user experience.
   - Read and write to FITS tables.
   - Keep the comments and IDs (possibly with letters) of the 
     original input table.
   - Add a form for users to provide their experience.
3. Fix any bugs I have not found yet!

Comments and suggestions:
----------------------------------------

I hope MockGals will be useful for you. If you find any problems in
this program please contact me so I can correct them. I would also be
very glad to hear any suggestions or comments you might have, thank
you.
