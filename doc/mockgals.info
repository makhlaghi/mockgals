1 An introduction.
******************

Making mock galaxies is very important in the process of understanding
our data.  'mockgals' was initially made with this exact intent.
Certain astronomical targets, for example elliptical galaxies, are very
sharp in their central regions, this makes a simple calculation of the
profile in the center of each pixel unrealistic for such cases.  The
main advantage of 'mockgals' is that it integrates the central parts of
profiles until a given accuracy.  It does this without any sorting or
ordering and in a very fast manner.

A summary of the advantages of 'mockgals' includes:
  1. Integration of the center of the profile.
  2. Very efficient in CPU usage, resuling in a very fast processing.
  3. Written in the C programming language, which is easy to understand
     and modify or contribute to by any interested user.
  4. [To be added] Can make profiles in any dimentions.
