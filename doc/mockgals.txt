and stars in an image and save the result in a FITS file.

1 About this manual
*******************

To get started with MockGals please go to the next chapter.

   The following sections are more general discussions.  In the first
section we will give a short review of the way modern science has become
intertwined with software and how important it is for scientists to have
very good understanding of the software they use.  After that you rights
as the reader of this document and user of MockGals are explained and in
the end of this chapter we give a short review of how this manual is
available for your use and a short summary of the manual.

1.1 Good science
================

We believe that if a software (a technique) is to be used in scientific
research, it has to be open source and open to scrutiny.  So any
critical/interested user can easily follow all the steps and understand
all their details and assumptions.  No software is perfect and there are
ultimately some flaws in any software that allow future generations to
find them and advance our experimental and theoretical knowledge of the
universe we live in.  With the progress of technology, scietific results
are increasing becoming more and more dependent on hard/software
techniques.  Therefore obscure software is arguably the biggest
roadblock in our aim to acheive this goal and a modern scientists cannot
claim to be interested in understanding the universe and our relation to
it, what ever their specific field, without accurately understanding the
software techniques used.

   To reach this goal, namely to let the users of a software be able to
understand its intricate details at their will, a software has to be
accompanied by a good and up to date manual.  The user of a software
cannot claim to understand how it works only based on the experience
they have gained in using it a lot or on mock simulations, that kind of
subjective experience is prone to very serious mis-understandings that
only help in producing dogmas.  Unfortunately in the commonly used
astronomical software, most are either closed source or don't have a
good manual.  The scientific results that are deduced from such software
are thus not objective, because in the former case scientists have to
look at it as a black box and trust its results on faith.  In the
latter, it is very hard to find enough time to understand the
programming of an open source project with out a clearly written manual
explaining all the ideas behind the major functions, data structures or
objects.  It is certainly time consuming for the programmer to make such
a manual, but if the greater common experience is considered, that time
put is very nicely invested.  Because through sharing of these
fundamental ideas that shape all our scientific results and keeping them
open to criticism, we can make them more robust and thus take better
steps in our endeavor to quench our curiosity in nature.

   Bjarne Stroustrup (creator of the 'C++' language) says: "Without
understanding software, you are reduced to believing in magic".  Ken
Thomson (the designer or the Unix operating system) has said very nicely
that "I abhor a system designed for the "user" if that word is a coded
pejorative meaning "stupid and unsophisticated"."  Both these cases
naturally apply more seriously to systems written for scientific
applications and as scientists we should be loyal to such principles if
we want to remain critical and be objective.  After all, all our data
and models are produced, archived and processed using hard/software.  We
cannot and should not accept any result through faith in the programmer
who wrote that particular program we are using to publish our papers.

1.2 Your rights
===============

mockgals is "free software"; this means that everyone is free to use it
and free to redistribute it on certain conditions.  mockgals is not in
the public domain; it is copyrighted and there are restrictions on its
distribution, but these restrictions are designed to permit everything
that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed
is to try to prevent others from further sharing any version of Texinfo
that they might get from you.

   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of the programs that relate to mockgals, that you receive
source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these
programs or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know
you can do these things.

   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of the mockgals related programs, you must give the recipients
all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must tell them their
rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for the programs that relate to
mockgals.  If these programs are modified by someone else and passed on,
we want their recipients to know that what they have is not what we
distributed, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on our reputation.

   The precise conditions of the licenses for the programs currently
being distributed that relate to mockgals are found in the General
Public Licenses that accompany them.  This manual is covered by the GNU
Free Documentation License (*note GNU Free Documentation License::).

   The paragraphs above, in this section, belong to the GNU Texinfo
manual and are not written by us!  We have just changed the name
"Texinfo" to "mockgals" because it and this manual are released under
the same licenses and it is beautifully written to inform you of your
rights.

1.3 How to read this manual
===========================

This manual is available in plain text, HTML, info, Docbook, PDF and
finally the Texinfo format.  The last one is the basis for creating all
the other formats.  As an initial introduction the PDF and HTML formats
might be easier to begin using mockgals, but if you would like to
understand the code, it is much easier to do it in the info format,
where for example in emacs, you can have one window on the code and
another on the info file explaining each function, the idea behind its
usage and how it is used in the Emacs '*info*' window.

   'info' is a very easy to use and particularly useful format for
software documentation.  We strongly recommend becoming familiar with it
if you are not because it can significantly enhance your experience in
programming and in GNU based operating systems (like GNU/Linux).  It is
very trivial made for reading manuals and getting facilitates navigating
in long manuals.  To learn more about it in any GNU/linux terminal you
can run: 'info info'.  It does a fantastic job in explaining its self in
practice interactively.

   The first chapter is a quick start, explaining the generalities of
Mockgals so the user can begin using it very fast.  The following
chapters give a much more detailed review of each step.

2 Quick start
*************

Once 'mockgals' is installed, if you simply run './mockgals' in the
installed directory, 45 mock galaxies and 5 stars will be randomly
positioned in a 'FITS' image of size 200*200.

3 Introduction
**************

Making mock galaxies is very important in the process of understanding
our data.  'mockgals' was initially made with this exact intent.
Certain astronomical targets, for example elliptical galaxies, are very
sharp in their central regions, this makes a simple calculation of the
profile in the center of each pixel unrealistic for such cases.  The
main advantage of 'mockgals' is that it integrates the central parts of
profiles until a given accuracy.  It does this without any sorting or
ordering and in a very fast manner.

A summary of the advantages of 'mockgals' includes:
  1. Integration of the center of the profile.
  2. Very efficient in CPU usage, resuling in a very fast processing.
  3. Written in the C programming language, which is easy to understand
     and modify or contribute to by any interested user.
  4. [To be added] Can make profiles in any dimentions.

4 Installation
**************

'mockgals' relys on only 3 packages: 'GSL' (for mathematical functions),
'FFTW' (for convolution) and 'cfitsio' (for reading to and from FITS
files).

5 Configuring mockgals.
***********************

Currently configuration paramters into 'mockgals' can only be given
through single letter commandline options.  The options are explained
below.

6 Mock parameters
*****************

The parameters of the profiles you want to build into a FITS image are
fed to it though a table.  In this section we will review how 'mockgals'
reads that table and how best to prepare it.

7 How mockgals works
********************

In this section we will give a complete review on how 'mockgals' works
and how this is implemented in its coding in order to facilitate your
reading of the code and possibly modifying it and making it better.
